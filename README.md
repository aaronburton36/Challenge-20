React Portfolio
A portfolio website created using React to showcase a web developer's projects and skills.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, run npm start to start the development server and view the website.

Usage
The portfolio website consists of a header, a section for content, and a footer. The header contains the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. The navigation titles include About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.

When you click on a navigation title, you are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. When you load the portfolio the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default.

When you are presented with the About Me section, you see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them. When you are presented with the Portfolio section, you see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.

When you are presented with the Contact section, you see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. If you move your cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you receive a notification that this field is required. If you enter text into the email address field, you receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address.

When you are presented with the Resume section, you see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
