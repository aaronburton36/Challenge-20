      <p>
      Hello, my name is [Aaaron Burton]! I'm a hard-working individual who has experience in both cooking and landscaping. Despite enjoying those jobs, I wanted to pursue a new career in the field of technology. I recently completed a full-stack web development bootcamp, where I gained experience in various programming languages, web development frameworks, and database management systems.

I am passionate about learning and growing as a developer, and I am excited about the opportunities that the tech industry has to offer. I am always looking for ways to challenge myself and improve my skills, both in and out of the workplace.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and spending time with friends and family. I am also an avid learner and enjoy exploring new technologies and programming languages.
